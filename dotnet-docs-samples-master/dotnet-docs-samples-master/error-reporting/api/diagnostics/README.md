    to visit Cloud Platform Console and enable the Stackdriver Error Reporting API.

3.  Open [ErrorReporting.sln](ErrorReporting.sln) with Microsoft Visual Studio version 2015 or later.

4. In [WebApiConfig.cs](App_Start/WebApiConfig.cs) change the placeholder value of "YOUR-PROJECT-ID" to be your project id.

5. Build the Solution.

6. Run the solution.

7. Visual Studio will open a web browser and attempt to load the sample web app. Visual Studio will then take focus and highlight the generic exception error that is thrown by the sample.

8. Continue running the sample by clicking the green *Continue* button or pressing F11.

9. The browser will display an XML error with the message "An error has occurred.".

10. Go back to Visual Studio and stop the program which will still be running.

    the [Error Reporting](https://console.cloud.google.com/errors) page
    in the Cloud Platform Console.
