# Google Endpoints and Google App Engine Flexible Environment

This sample application demonstrates how to implement a Google Endpoint
with a .NET *core* application running in Google App Engine Flexible Environment.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Follow the instructions in the [root README](../../../README.md).**
  
2.  Install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/).  The Google Cloud SDK
    is required to deploy .NET applications to App Engine.

2.  Install [.NET Core 1.0.3 SDK Preview 2 build 3156](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archives/1.0.3-preview2-download.md).

2.  Visual Studio is not required, but to build and run .NET *core* applications,
    Visual Studio users need to download and install 
	[.NET Core tools](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windowsvs2015).

3.  [Google Cloud Tools for Visual Studio](
	https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GoogleCloudTools.GoogleCloudPlatformExtensionforVisualStudio)
    make it easy to deploy to App Engine.  Install them if you are running Visual Studio.

4.  Follow the instructions in the [Quickstart for Endpoints on App Engine Flexible Environment](
	https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/quickstart-app-engine).
