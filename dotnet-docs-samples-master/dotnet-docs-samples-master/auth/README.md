## Authentication Sample

A sample demonstrating how to authenticate with Google's APIs using Application Default Credentials
[Application Default Credentials](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials)
from C#. The sample authenticates and then makes an API request to the Cloud Storage API.

## Build and Run

1.  **Follow the instructions in the [root README](../../README.md)**.

3.  **Install the Google Cloud SDK**.
    If you haven't already installed the Google Cloud SDK, [install and
    initialize the Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/) now.
    The SDK contains tools and libraries that enable you to create and manage
    resources on Google Cloud Platform.

4.  **Enable APIs for your project**.
    [Click here](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=storage_api&showconfirmation=true)
    to visit Cloud Platform Console and enable the Cloud Storage API.

5.  **Create a Cloud Storage bucket for your project**.
    Cloud Storage allows you to store and serve binary data.
    A bucket is a high-level container for binary objects.
    At a command prompt, type:

    ```sh
    C:\> gsutil mb gs://<your-project-id>
    C:\> gsutil defacl set public-read gs://<your-project-id>
    ```

6.  Open [AuthSample.sln](AuthSample.sln) with Microsoft Visual Studio version 2012 or later.
7.  Build the Solution.
8.  From the command line, set environment variables and run:

    ```sh
    C:\...\bin\Debug> set GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=your project id displayed on the Google Developers Console.
    C:\...\bin\Debug> AuthSample <the name of the Google Cloud Storage bucket you created>
    ```
